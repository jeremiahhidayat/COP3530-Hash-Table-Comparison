# How to Load Data
To get the whole data file, visit this [link](https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.basics.tsv.gz). 
Extract the file and put the `title.basics.tsv` file here.

I may add a sample file with the less datapoints but can but added to git later. I think the full file would be 
better to measure performance though.
