<h1> How to Load Data </h1>
To get the whole data file, visit this [link](https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.basics.tsv.gz). Extract the file and 
then put the title.basics.tsv file here.

I may add a sample file with the less datapoints but can but added to git later. I think the full file would be 
better to measure performance though.
